# Carputer

A custom Qt5/QML in-car head unit application built for embedded Linux (Buildroot). Designed to run fullscreen on a dedicated car PC, providing media playback, real-time vehicle telemetry, climate control, and remote vehicle functions through a clean, themeable interface.

## Features

### Media Player
- Audio playback via GStreamer `playbin` pipeline
- ID3 tag reading — displays track title, artist, and album
- Embedded album artwork display with folder art fallback (`folder.jpg` / `cover.jpg`)
- Real-time audio spectrum visualizer (32-band FFT via GStreamer `spectrum` element)
- Repeat modes: None, Repeat All, Repeat One
- Shuffle with Fisher-Yates algorithm
- Playlist and Album browse views
- USB/SD media scanning

### Dashboard
- Large analog speedometer and RPM gauges
- Centre panel with 3 tappable views: Now Playing, Trip Computer, Performance
- Real-time sensor data: speed, RPM, fuel level, coolant temp, oil pressure, oil temp, battery, intake/ambient temp, brake fluid
- Warning system with caution/danger/critical levels and dismissable popup overlay
- Compact quick-controls bar: climate, fan speed, HVAC/AC/Auto, door lock, windows, remote start

### Theming
- 7 built-in themes: Dark, Light, Blue, Red, Green, Purple, Orange
- Custom accent colour picker
- Theme and accent colour persist across reboots via QSettings

### Other Pages
- Backup camera feed
- Dashcam / DVR recording
- Settings page

### Connectivity
- ESP32 wireless module support via WiFi (car control, sensor data)
- Bluetooth (bluez5)
- SSH access via Dropbear

## Building

This app is built as part of a custom Buildroot image. It is not intended to be built standalone on a desktop Linux system.

```bash
# From the Buildroot tree root
make carputer-dirclean && make carputer -j$(nproc)
```

Deploy to target:
```bash
scp output/target/usr/bin/carputer root@<target-ip>:/usr/bin/carputer
```

Restart the service:
```bash
systemctl restart carputer
```

---

## Configuration

Settings are stored via QSettings at:
```
~/.config/openipc/godseye.ini
```

Key settings include video port, audio sink, theme, accent colour, DVR directory, climate defaults, and serial port assignments for the ESP32 modules.

---

## Origins

Carputer was built by gutting and rebuilding [Godseye](https://github.com/devkid/godseye) — an FPV drone ground station app — repurposing its Buildroot environment, Qt5/QML architecture, and GStreamer pipeline patterns for automotive use. Most of the hard Buildroot and toolchain work was inherited from that project.
